DesignSpace is a Django-powered web application tailored for designers, including interior designers, 3D architectural artists, and other creative professionals. This platform connects project owners with designers who can bring their visions to life, fostering a collaborative and dynamic environment for creative work.

Overview
DesignSpace serves as a digital workspace where:

Project Owners can post work requests or job openings related to design, architecture, or 3D visualization.
Designers can browse available projects, submit applications, and, if approved, start working on the projects.
The platform is ideal for designers who want to showcase their skills, find new opportunities, and connect with clients seeking creative talent.

Project Listings: Project Owners can create detailed job postings, including project requirements, timelines, and budgets.
